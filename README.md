# Hello there!
Welcome to my path-finding visualizer! Obiviously it's inspired from the Clement's original path-finding visualizer.
For those who're new to this project, it's visualization tool to visualize classic graph algorithms like Dijsktra, A* and etc.
I have been working so hard for this project for the last few months, so giving this repo a star would just give me little happiness :sweat_smile:

## Here is the preview images for my project:
### Before visualization:

### after visualization(ofcourse I just changed the theme from dark mode to light mode for this image):
This is the result after executing a maze generation algorithm and path-finding algorithm.
